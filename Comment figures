Figure 1. We have already shown that the Nonsynonymous/Synonymous Substitution ratio (KaKs ratio) could effectively measure evolutionary pressure in other bacteria 
such as Helicobacter pylori. Distribution of the Ka/Ks ratio in all the protein-coding genes from the pangenome, where different groups are highlighted (different colors) 
and genes that encode for uncharacterized proteins (asterisks). Black dots represent the median of the distribution

Figure 2. Proof of concept. A different annotation is observed when comparing the region 40211-47135 in both versions of the ATCC 17978 strain. The previous version 
has two different genes, whereas the new version has only one. The evolutionary comparison with 2200 strains indicates a better result when the most current version 
of the region is used as a reference since the KaKs ratio is lower. The sequence-level comparison shows changes that cause a frameshift in the previous version. 

Figure 3. Estimation of evolutionary selection in differentially annotated genes. 
The changes in the KaKs ratio, depending on the version of the gene used as a reference, are represented with lines of a different colour (green bars when the ratio 
improves and red bars when the ratio does not improve). The KaKs ratio improved mostly when the most current version gene is used as a reference. The dashed black line represents 
the kaks ratio of 1.
